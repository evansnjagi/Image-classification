# üêæ Wildlife Image Classification

This Project is aimed at classifying images of wildlife animals in Ta√Ø National Park. The Images are collected by trap cameras which are used to study and monitor wildlife population. The anormous amount of data collected is used to track wildlife as well as conserving it. 

# Problem statement

- With a large number of images, it becomes quite hard and time consuming to manually classify an image at a time.
- It's expensive to employ a large number of people to do the classification manually
- Accuracy is also important here.

<p> So coming up with a cnn Model is vital and a good step to make. This project is aimed at classifying those images with the best accuracy we can achieve.</p>
<p> The Final result of our predicted targets should be mapped to a dataframe and save for future us</p>

# Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Feature engineering
3. Splitting
4. Modelling
5. Cross validation
6. ID mapping
